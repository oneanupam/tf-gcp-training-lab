# Terraform Concept Codes
This repository contains terraform concept code sets for learning and testing different terraform concepts.

## Prerequisites
Below prerequisites must be fulfilled for successful execution of terraform concept code sets.

### Software Requirement
Resources in this repository are meant to use with Terraform 1.3.6 (check the terraform version using: `terraform version`). If you don't have the compatible version, download it from official Terraform repository.

-   [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) >= 414.0.0
-   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.3.6

> [!NOTE]
> See [Installation-Guide](https://gist.github.com/anupam-sy/7458df6506e8e3cfb28c0ff56fab546a) on how to install Terraform.

### Permissions Requirement
**Option-01:** If you are using terraform on your workstation, It is recommended that you authenticate using User Application Default Credentials ("ADCs") as a primary authentication method. You can enable ADCs by running the command.

```
    gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Option-02:** You can create a Service Account and reference service account key file in providers configuration block.

```
    provider "google" {
        credentials = file("./credentials/service_account_key.json")
    }
```

Whatever option you choose, make sure to provide the following roles to selected principle (User/ServiceAccount).
- `roles/resourcemanager.projectOwner` on all the projects where you want to house your resources using service account's email.
- `roles/storage.admin` on the GCS bucket housing terraform state files. This role is required in case of using GCS backend.

> [!NOTE]
> Access can be more fine-grained to follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP).
> You can explore the other authentication options by reviewing the references and use the best suited for your usecase.

### Project Requirement
It is required to create a Project on Google Cloud Platform to test and deploy the services. In order to use the google cloud services in a GCP Project, respective service API(s) must be enabled before resource deployment. You can either enable these using terraform or using gcloud command. Sample examples are mentioned below -

1. Use terraform code snip to enable google cloud service APIs
```
    // Locals block to define required service APIs
    locals {
    googleapis = [
        "compute.googleapis.com",
        "cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com",
        "iam.googleapis.com"
        ]
    }

    // Resource block to enable required service APIs
    resource "google_project_service" "apis" {
    for_each = toset(local.googleapis)

    project                = "[UPDATE_PROJECT_ID]"
    service                = each.key
    disable_on_destroy     = false
    }
```

2. Use gcloud command to enable google cloud service APIs
```
	gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
	    cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
	    compute.googleapis.com \
	    iam.googleapis.com
```

### Remote Backend Setup
For local backend, terraform state file is stored locally in the current working directory. To use a remote backend (to enable the collaboration of other team members), create a google cloud storage bucket in a GCP project and enable the versioning. Use below gcloud commands to created and set up gcs backend bucket.

```
    gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
    gsutil mb -c standard -l eu gs://bucket-name
    gsutil versioning set on gs://bucket-name
```

## TF Code Execution
To execute the Terraform code, go to command prompt and then run the following commands:

-   [Required] `terraform init` # To initialize the terraform working directory.
-   [Optional] `terraform validate` # To validate the terraform configuration.
-   [Optional] `terraform fmt` # To format the terraform configuration to a canonical format and style.
-   [Optional] `terraform plan` # To create an execution plan for terraform configuration files.
-   [Required] `terraform apply -auto-approve` # To execute the actions proposed in a terraform plan to create, update, or destroy infrastructure.
-   [Optional] `terraform destroy -auto-approve` # To destroy the created infrastructure. Specific resources can be destroyed using resource targeting.

> [!CAUTION]
> Run `terraform destroy` command with caution as it can destroy all the deployed infrastructure.
